# Hello there, This repo contains the code & benchmakrsfor the coding challenge for the RISC-V Port & Polish project.

## The '1dARRAY' directory contains code that uses continuous memory allotment to fill in the matrices. 

## The '2dARRAY' directory contains code that uses double pointers to store the matrices as 2D arrays.

## The 'Vector Optimized' directory contains benchmark results which used vector instructions via compiler flags.
