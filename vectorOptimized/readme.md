Following the faster 1-D approach, this time the program was compiled with the vector instruction flags.<br/>

This approach is strikingly better performing than any of the previous approaches.<br/>

The naiveVec.txt file contains the benchmarks for the naive approach, and the tileVec.txt contains benchmarks for the loop-tiling approach.<br/>
